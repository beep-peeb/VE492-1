# VE492


Projects for VE492


Project 1: Pacman search: DFS,BFS,UCS and A*. There is something wrong with one test case, you can simply change the type int to float.

Project 2: Multiagent: if you want the version with applying search method, you can download the previous version(change the Maze distance to Manhattan Distance). You can also change the search method in the latest version, such as DFS and BFS. The reason I select Astar is that it performs better in the Reflex agent but it will cause time exceeds problem in the JOJ and get 5 points out of 6. 


Project 3: Reinforcement Learning.


Project 4: CSP


Project 5: Baye's net.
